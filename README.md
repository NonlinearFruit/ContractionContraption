# Contraction Contraption

This android app records contractions. That is what it does and that is all it does and it hopes to do it well (as it is improved over the course of my wife's future pregnancies). 

## Background

Our daughter was overdue by 2 weeks and I thought to write a quick app for tracking contractions (specifically the intervals in between). Soon after this decision, our daughter came. So this app is currently super simple and awaiting the conception of our next child.
